stylibrary
==========

Stylibrary is a collection of front-end style guides. If you come across
a good guide as you browse the web, hit me up a pull request!

The site is based on a very simple implementation of Jekyll, so all
you need to do is add the link to the yaml front matter at the top of
`index.html`.
